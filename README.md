## PNG Encoder in Rust

PNG is an image file format specified by [W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/png-3/). The goal of this project is to build a PNG encoder in Rust. The user will provide a vector of tuples (R,G,B) and the width of the image in pixels. The program will output a PNG file that conforms to the specs, and therefore, can be opened and edited in programs like Photoshop, Affinity Photo, Windows Photo, etc.
